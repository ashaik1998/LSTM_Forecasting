# Time Series Forecasting using LSTM

This repository contains code and documentation for a time series forecasting project using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The goal of this project is to predict future temperatures using seven years of weather data obtained from the Max Planck Institute's weather dataset.

## Data Source

The weather data used in this project is sourced from the Max Planck Institute and is available at [Max Planck Institute - Weather Data](https://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/wetter/).

## Approach

### 1. Moving Window Average

We start with a simple baseline model, the Moving Window Average. This approach calculates the average temperature over a fixed window of time and serves as a reference point for evaluating the performance of more complex models like LSTM.

### 2. LSTM Model

We implement a more sophisticated LSTM architecture to capture temporal dependencies and nonlinear patterns in the data. The LSTM model consists of multiple LSTM layers with 32 units each, followed by a dense layer for output prediction. We utilize the Adam optimizer and train the model over 10 epochs to minimize the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) loss function.

### Evaluation Metric

To evaluate the performance of our models, we calculate the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metric. The MAE represents the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual temperatures.

## Results

After training the models, we achieved an MAE of 0.19 with the LSTM model, indicating its effectiveness in capturing the underlying patterns in the temperature data.

## Feature Engineering

We explore the impact of using single and multi-feature inputs on model performance. In the single-feature scenario, we only consider temperature data for prediction. In contrast, the multi-feature scenario incorporates additional variables such as pressure and density alongside temperature, enabling the model to capture more nuanced relationships in the data.
